This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Environments

This project is currently deployed at [https://nextjs-project-template-gamma.vercel.app/](https://nextjs-project-template-gamma.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Pages

* `pages/_app.tsx` - The entry point of the application
* `pages/index.tsx` - The home page
* `pages/portfolio` - The portfolio refactor code sample
### API Routes

* `GET /api/status` - simple status / health check endpoint
* `GET /api/chart` - returns a hardcoded array of objects used in the portfolio refactor experience
* `GET /api/table` - returns a hardcoded array of objects used in the portfolio refactor experience

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
